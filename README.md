# SE-Assignment-4
Assignment: GitHub and Visual Studio
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of GitHub and Visual Studio. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Introduction to GitHub:

What is GitHub, and what are its primary functions and features? Explain how it supports collaborative software development.
It is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. 
It's primary functions : 
- Hosting Git repositories.
- Provides developers with tools to ship better code.
 Github supports collaborative software development through fork and pull requests and through shared repositories. Through shared repositories, individuals and teams can be contributors with read, write or adminstrator access. A fork is a copy of a project under a developer's personal account, the pull and fork model allows anyone who can view the project to contribute, the fork can either be kept separate or merged with the origibal project via a pull request.


Repositories on GitHub:

What is a GitHub repository? Describe how to create a new repository and the essential elements that should be included in it.
A github repository is the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history.
To create a new repository:
- On the personal github page account, click the + icon on the top right side of the page and select New repository on the drop-down menu that appears.
- Once the new page opens, give the repository a name that is unique( has not been used before). You can also give a short desciption about the repository though it is optional.
- Choose to either make the repo private or public.
- Add a README file. This is the file which contains a long description of the project in the repository.
- You can also add a .gitignore file. These are the files that you don't want to track from a list of templates.
- You can also choose a license which tells others what they can and can't do with your code.
- Finally, click on Create Repository to create your repository.


Version Control with Git:

Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Version control in Git enables developers to see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions and progression of any project in one place. 

Branching and Merging in GitHub:

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch. 
A branch is a new/separate vaersion of the main repository. They are important as they allow one to develop features, fix bugs or safely experiment with new ideas in a contained area of your repository.
To create a branch : 
- On the main page of the repository, select the main button and at the drop down, select the view all branches option.
- A new page will be opened and in the new page, click "New Branch" on the top right, then under "Branch name", key in a name for the branch.
- Under the "Branch Source". choose a source for the branch.
- Click Create branch and the branch will be created.
To merge changes to the main branch:
- In the repository, click "Pull requests" and click the pull request you would like to merge.
- Scroll to the bottom of the pull request and choose a merge option available for your repository.
- When prompted, type a commit message or accept the default message. Click confirm merge, confirm squash and merge or confirm rebase and merge depending on the option choden previously.


Pull Requests and Code Reviews:

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. It facilitates code reviews by allowing others to review your proposed changed, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request.
To create a pull request:
- On the main page of the repository, click the "main" button and in the drop-down choose the branch containing your commits.
- Above the list of files in the yellow banner, click Compare & Pull request to create a pull request.
- select the branch you would like to merge the changes into.
- Type a title and description for the pull request then click "Create Pull Request"


GitHub Actions:

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.


Introduction to Visual Studio:

What is Visual Studio, and what are its key features? How does it differ from Visual Studio Code?
Visual Studio is an integrated development environment(IDE) developed ny Microsoft that is used to develop computer programs including websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio differs from VS Code as Vs code is source-code editor while Visual studio is an Integrated Development environment.


Integrating GitHub with Visual Studio:

Describe the steps to integrate a GitHub repository with Visual Studio. How does this integration enhance the development workflow?


Debugging in Visual Studio:

Explain the debugging tools available in Visual Studio. How can developers use these tools to identify and fix issues in their code?


Collaborative Development using GitHub and Visual Studio:

Discuss how GitHub and Visual Studio can be used together to support collaborative development. Provide a real-world example of a project that benefits from this integration.


Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
